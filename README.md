It utilizes web scraping techniques to automate the extraction process.
Implementation:


#### Data Source: 
The Movie Database website (https://www.themoviedb.org/)


#### Tasks: 
Each task involves accessing specific types of information from the website.


#### Documentation: 
Code examples provided in the documentation are adapted for each task.


### Potential Extensions:
The project can be extended to gather data from additional websites or to include more detailed information about movies.

Automation scripts can be developed to periodically update the dataset with the latest movie releases and information.


### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of a programmatic approach to extract and format data from web pages, fulfilling the business requirement of gathering movie-related information for analysis. By leveraging web scraping techniques, it helps efficient access to vast amounts of data spread across multiple web pages, paving the way for significant insights.
